# pycma
A Python implementation of CMA-ES and a few related numerical optimization tools. 

The API Documentation is available [here](http://cma.gforge.inria.fr/apidocs-pycma).

## Installation

Download and unzip the code (see green button above). Then type in the "root"
folder, where the ``cma`` folder is visible,

    pip install -e cma

to install the package. Moving the ``cma`` folder away from this location would 
invalidate the installation.

Alternatively, when the ``cma`` folder is moved into a folder visible to Python 
(e.g. the current folder), ``import cma`` works without any installation. 

## Installation of the [latest release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cma)
Typing
```
  pip install cma
```
in a system shell installs the [most recent _release_](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cma)
from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). The release link
also provides a quick start guide.
