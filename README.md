# pycma
A Python implementation of CMA-ES and a few related numerical optimization tools. 

The API Documentation is available [here](http://cma.gforge.inria.fr/apidocs-pycma).

## Installation

Download and unzip the code (see green button above). 

- When the ``cma`` source code folder is copied or moved into a folder visible to Python, 
  namely a folder which is in the Python path (e.g. the current folder), ``import cma`` 
  works without any further installation.

- Or install the package by typing within the "root" folder, where the ``cma`` source 
  code folder is visible,

      pip install -e cma

  Moving the ``cma`` folder away from this location would invalidate the 
  installation.

## Installation of the [latest release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cma)

in a system shell installs the [most recent _release_](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cma)
from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). The [release link](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cma)
