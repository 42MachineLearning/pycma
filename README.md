# pycma
A Python implementation of CMA-ES and a few related numerical optimization tools. 

The API Documentation is available [here](http://cma.gforge.inria.fr/apidocs-pycma).

## Installation

After downloading the code, typing in the "root" folder, where folder ``cma`` is 
visible,

    pip install -e cma

will install the package. Moving the folder away from this location would 
invalidate the installation.

When the "root" folder is in the visible path of Python (e.g. the current 
folder) ``import cma`` works without installation. 

## Installation of the [latest release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cma)
Typing
```
  pip install cma
```
in a system shell installs the [most recent release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cma)
from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). The release link
also provides a quick start guide.
